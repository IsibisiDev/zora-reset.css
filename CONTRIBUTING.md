* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
